## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

This repo will include:

- ✅ **Cypress Test Suites**  
  Realistic and modular E2E testing using Cypress (JavaScript & TypeScript).

- 🔁 **Smoke Tests with AI Agents**  
  Hybrid smoke tests enhanced with intelligent decision logic powered by AI.

- 🤖 **Custom AI Agents**  
  Scripts and prototypes of agents that automate QA tasks using:
  - `LangChain` (Python & TypeScript)
  - `OpenAI`, `Llama`, and other LLM providers

- 🐍 **Python Automation Scripts**  
  Command-line utilities and tools for test orchestration, reporting, or test data generation.

- 📦 **TypeScript Utilities & Agents**  
  Modern TypeScript agents using Node.js and AI SDKs for smart validation and automation.
